Hi!

This is my chess board simulator project. I used CSS and HTML to design the program 
and Javascript to program the actual logic, as well as to implement other design aspects like the chess piece designs.

This program is not exactly a chess "simulator" more of just a simulation of having a chess board, but online. It will show you the options you have to move
your piece in green squares when you click on it, but you are still free to make illegal moves so it helps if you are familiar with the rules of chess already. 

The only thing you need is to install python3. In your terminal, make sure you are in the directory in which these files are saved. Then, type
python3 -m http.server into your terminal, this will host the local server to run this. Finally, open the browser of your choice and go to 
http://localhost:8000, and from there you are free to play!
